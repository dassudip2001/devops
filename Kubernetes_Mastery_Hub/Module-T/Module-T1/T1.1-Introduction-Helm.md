# Introduction to Helm - [Link](https://helm.sh/docs/)

### What is Helm?

- Helm is a **package manager** for Kubernetes applications.
- It simplifies and streamlines the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications by packaging them into **charts**.

Helm chart
: is a collection of pre-configured Kubernetes resources that can be easily deployed and managed as a single unit.

### **Why need Helm?**

- **Reusability:** Helm packages applications and dependencies into reusable **charts**, in a way that's easy to share and deploy.
- **Versioning:** Helm charts can be versioned, making it simple to track changes and upgrade or roll back applications.
- **Templating:** Helm uses **Go**(the programming language) templating to dynamically generate Kubernetes manifest files, enabling configuration flexibility without duplicating code.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Helm manages releases, making complex deployments in Kubernetes clusters easier to handle.

### **Comparison with native Kubernetes manifests:**

| Aspect                        | Native K8s Manifests                         | Helm Charts                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Configuration Type**        | Static YAML files                            | Higher abstraction with dynamic configuration using Go templating     |
| **Efficiency and Modularity** | Cumbersome for managing growing applications | Efficient application management, promoting modularity and code reuse |
| **Versioning**                | External versioning                          | Inherent versioning for easier change tracking and release management |

## Helm Architecture

1.  **User Interaction**: You, the user, interact with Helm using its command-line interface, which is like your direct line to Helm's powers.
2.  **Helm CLI**: When you issue commands like `helm install` or `helm upgrade`, think of it as sending instructions directly to Helm's brain. The Helm CLI is where the magic begins.
3.  **Kubernetes API Server**: Now, Helm needs to talk to the Kubernetes cluster, so it chats up the Kubernetes API server. This server is like the main switchboard of your Kubernetes world, handling all the requests and coordination.
4.  **Kubernetes Cluster**: Here's where the action happens! Your Kubernetes cluster is like a bustling city, with nodes (or servers) where your applications live. When Helm wants to deploy or manage applications, it's basically sending them into this bustling city.

> **`Tiller`** is deprecated.

- **Tiller** was used, a server-side component in **Helm version 2**,
- It interacted with the Kubernetes API server on **behalf** of the Helm client.
- However, due to **security concerns**, Helm version 3 removed Tiller,
- and **Helm 3 interacts directly with the Kubernetes API server** from the client side.
