# Installing Terraform on Different OS - [Link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

## What is terraform?

- Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.
- It was open source but not now.
- Terraform uses a declarative configuration language to describe the desired state of your infrastructure.

## **Advantages of Using Terraform for IaC:**

1.  **Declarative Syntax:** Describes what you want without getting into the nitty-gritty details.
2.  **Multi-Cloud Support:** Works smoothly with different cloud providers, giving you options.
3.  **Resource Graph:** Plans and deploys resources in the right order, preventing issues.
4.  **State Management:** Keeps track of your current setup, preventing conflicts during changes.
5.  **Community and Ecosystem:** Taps into a helpful community and pre-built modules, saving time and ensuring best practices.
