# Terraform State Management

## Terraform State Management

- It is like how git manages the code, it manages the infrastructure.

- Terraform State Management refers to how Terraform keeps track of the infrastructure it creates and manages.

## **Benefits of Terraform State Management:**

1.  **Track Infrastructure State:**

    - Keeps a record of current infrastructure configurations.

2.  **Manage Resource Dependencies:**

    - Organizes relationships between different resources.

3.  **Idempotent Operations:**

    - Applies changes efficiently to achieve the desired state.

4.  **Enable Team Collaboration:**

    - Facilitates teamwork through a shared view of infrastructure.

## **Remote and Local State Management:**

Terraform supports two primary methods for managing state: **local state** and **remote state**.

1.  **Local State:**

    - **Storage:** Stored in a local file within the working directory (e.g., `terraform.tfstate`).
    - **Suitability:** Suitable for individual use or small teams, but not recommended for collaboration.

2.  **Remote State:**

    - **Storage:** Stored remotely, often in a shared location such as object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Storage) or a version-controlled system (e.g., Terraform Cloud, HashiCorp Consul).
    - **Advantages:**
      - Facilitates collaboration among team members.
      - Improves security by centralizing state management.
