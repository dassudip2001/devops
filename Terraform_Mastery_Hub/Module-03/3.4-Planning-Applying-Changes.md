# Planning `terraform plan` and Applying `terraform apply` Changes

## **`terraform plan` and `terraform apply` Commands:**

1.  **`terraform plan`:**

    - Examines the current state and configuration.
    - Generates an execution plan detailing the actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state.
    - Provides insights into what resources will be created, modified, or destroyed.

2.  **`terraform apply`:**

    - Applies the changes proposed in the execution plan.
    - Modifies infrastructure to match the configuration.
    - Creates, updates, or destroys resources as needed.
    - Not to interact with cli -> `terraform apply -auto-approve`

## Terraform Destroy

- To target a particular module -> `terraform destroy -target=module.<MODULE_NAME>`

## **Understanding and Reviewing Execution Plans:**

- Key points to consider when reviewing a plan:

  - **Resource Actions:**

    - Indicates whether Terraform will create, update, or destroy a resource.

  - **Changes to Outputs:**

    - Lists any changes to outputs.

  - **Variables:**

    - Displays variable values.
