# 1.1 Overview of Configuration Management and Automation

## **Configuration Management**

- Once your infrastructure is ready, Configuration Management comes into play by allowing you to simultaneously configure and maintain software and settings across all servers.

- This ensures consistency and reliability by automating tasks such as installing software, updating configurations, and maintaining uniformity throughout your infrastructure.

## **Automation:**

- Use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention.
- **USE**
  - no human or manual error
  - task is accelerated

## **Why Configuration Management and Automation?**

- **Consistency:** Ensures that systems are configured uniformly, reducing the risk of configuration drift.
- **Efficiency:** Automating repetitive tasks saves time and resources.
- **Reliability:** Automated processes are less prone to human error, enhancing system reliability.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale infrastructure and operations without a proportional increase in manual effort.
