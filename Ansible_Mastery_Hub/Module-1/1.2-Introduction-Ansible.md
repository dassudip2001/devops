# 1.2 Introduction to Ansible

## 1.2.1 History

**Background:** Ansible, first released in 2012, was created by Michael DeHaan. It was developed to address the challenges associated with configuration management and automation, providing a simpler, agentless alternative to other tools available at the time.

**Key Milestones:**

- **2012:** Ansible is introduced with a focus on simplicity, ease of use, and agentless architecture.
- **2015:** Red Hat acquires Ansible, further contributing to its growth and integration with other Red Hat products.
- **2021:** Ansible has become one of the most widely adopted automation tools, known for its flexibility and community support.

## 1.2.2 Architecture

**Agentless Design:**

- Ansible follows an **agentless architecture**, meaning there is no need to install a client or agent on managed nodes.
- Instead, Ansible relies on SSH (Secure Shell) to communicate with remote servers.
- Ansible uses a **push-based mechanism** over SSH, making it agentless.

**Components:**

- **Control Node:** The machine where Ansible is installed. It contains playbooks, inventory files, and Ansible modules.
- **Managed Nodes:** Systems that Ansible manages. They only require SSH and Python (for Ansible modules) to be pre-installed; no agents are needed.
- **Inventory:** A configuration file that defines the managed nodes and their grouping. It can be static or dynamic.

## 1.2.3 Key Components

**Playbooks:**

- Ansible playbooks are written in YAML and define a set of tasks to be executed on managed nodes.
- They are human-readable and allow for easy understanding and modification.

**Modules:**

- Ansible modules are small units of work executed by Ansible on the managed nodes.
- Modules can perform various tasks, such as system commands, package installations, or file manipulations.

**Tasks:**

- Tasks are individual units within a playbook, representing actions to be taken on the managed nodes.
- They define the desired state of the system, and Ansible ensures that the system reaches that state.
