# 5.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Ansible Tower

**RBAC in Ansible Tower:**

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Ansible Tower allows administrators to define and enforce user permissions based on roles. RBAC enhances security and ensures that users have the appropriate level of access to Tower resources.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Organizations:**

    - Logical containers that provide separation and isolation.
    - Each organization has its own inventory, projects, and settings.

2.  **Teams:**

    - Groups of users with shared access and permissions.
    - Users belong to one or more teams within an organization.

3.  **Roles:**

    - Define what actions users or teams can perform within Ansible Tower.
    - Examples of roles include Administrator, Auditor, and Job Executor.

**RBAC Implementation:**

1.  **Create Organizations:**

    - Divide Ansible Tower into logical organizations based on business units or departments.

2.  **Create Teams:**

    - Define teams within each organization.
    - Assign users to teams based on their roles and responsibilities.

3.  **Define Roles:**

    - Customize roles to match the needs of your organization.
    - Common roles include Administrator, Auditor, and Job Executor.

4.  **Assign Roles to Teams:**

    - Assign roles to teams to control access to Tower resources.
    - Specify the level of access each role grants (e.g., read-only, execute).

5.  **User Management:**

    - Add individual users to teams or organizations.
    - Assign roles to individual users for fine-grained access control.

**Example RBAC Scenario:**

1.  **Organization Structure:**

    - Create organizations for IT, Development, and Operations.

2.  **Teams:**

    - Create teams within each organization (e.g., IT Admins, Developers, Ops Team).

3.  **Roles:**

    - Define roles such as Administrator, Auditor, and Job Executor.

4.  **Assign Roles:**

    - Assign roles to teams to control their access within the organization.

5.  **User Assignment:**

    - Add individual users to teams or organizations.
    - Assign specific roles to users based on their responsibilities.
