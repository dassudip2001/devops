# 4.2 Security Best Practices for Ansible

**Best Practices:**

1.  **Use Ansible Vault for Sensitive Data:**

    - Encrypt sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and other confidential data using Ansible Vault.
    - Ensure that sensitive data is not stored in plain text within playbooks.

2.  **Limit Privileges:**

    - Run Ansible playbooks with the least privilege necessary. Avoid running playbooks as the root user unless absolutely required.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege to minimize the potential impact of security breaches.

3.  **Secure File Permissions:**

    - Set appropriate file permissions for Ansible configuration files and playbooks to restrict access.
    - Regularly audit and update file permissions to maintain a secure environment.

4.  **Update Ansible Regularly:**

    - Keep Ansible up to date by regularly updating to the latest version.
    - Regularly check for security patches and improvements provided by the Ansible community.

5.  **Audit Playbooks:**

    - Regularly review and audit Ansible playbooks for security vulnerabilities and best practices.
    - Implement version control for playbooks to track changes and identify potential security issues.

**Example Playbook with Security Best Practices:**

```yaml
---
- name: Secure Configuration
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Copy Configuration File
      copy:
        src: /path/to/secure.conf
        dest: /etc/secure_app/secure.conf
      # Additional secure options...

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Secure App
      service:
        name: secure_app
        state: restarted
```

In this example, security best practices are applied by limiting privileges, securing file permissions, and ensuring secure handling of sensitive configurations.
