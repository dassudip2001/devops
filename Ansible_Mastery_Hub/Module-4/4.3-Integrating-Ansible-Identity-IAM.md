# 4.3 Integrating Ansible with Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**IAM Integration:**

1.  **Use Service Accounts:**

    - Create dedicated service accounts in Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems for Ansible automation.
    - Assign the necessary permissions to these service accounts based on the specific tasks they need to perform.

2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

    - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies to define and manage roles within Ansible.
    - Assign roles to users or service accounts to control their access to Ansible resources.

3.  **Secure API Keys and Credentials:**

    - Store API keys, access tokens, and other credentials securely using Ansible Vault.
    - Avoid hardcoding credentials in playbooks or configuration files.

**Example IAM Integration:**

```yaml
---
- name: IAM Integration
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Use AWS CLI with IAM Credentials
      command: aws s3 ls
      environment:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "{{ lookup('env', 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID') }}"
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "{{ lookup('env', 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY') }}"
```

In this example, the IAM credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) are sourced from environment variables. This demonstrates a secure way to provide credentials to Ansible tasks without exposing them in playbooks.

IAM integration enhances security by aligning Ansible with established identity and access management practices. It allows organizations to enforce policies, manage permissions, and enhance the overall security posture of Ansible automation.
