# 2.3 Running Ansible Playbooks

### 1\. **Install Ansible:**

- Ensure Ansible is installed on your control machine.

### 2\. **Create an Inventory File:**

- Create an inventory file (`inventory.ini`) listing the target hosts or groups.

### 3\. **Write a Simple Playbook:**

- Create a playbook file (`my_playbook.yml`) in YAML format.

```yaml
---
- name: My First Playbook
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```

### 4\. Run the Playbook

- Execute the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini my_playbook.yml
```

### 5\. **Verify Results:**

- Check the output for any errors or changes made during playbook execution.

### Tips:

- **Useful Modules:**

  - Explore Ansible modules for various tasks. Refer to the official documentation for module details.

- **Variables:**

  - Leverage variables to make playbooks dynamic and reusable. Define variables in the playbook or use external files.

- **Roles:**

  - As your infrastructure grows, consider organizing tasks into roles for better structure and reusability.

- **Handlers:**

  - Use handlers for tasks that should be triggered only when changes occur. Handlers are defined separately and invoked using `notify`.

- **Check Mode:**

  - Run playbooks in check mode (`--check`) to simulate changes without actually applying them. Useful for previewing changes.

- **Vault:**

  - Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive information such as passwords or secret keys.
