# 2.1 Writing Ansible Playbooks

## 2.1.1 Syntax

**Playbook Structure:**

An Ansible playbook is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks to be executed on managed nodes. The basic structure includes:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook Name
  hosts: group_name
  become: yes # Optional, allows running tasks with elevated privileges

  tasks:
    - name: Task Name
      <module_name>: <module_options>
```

- `name`: Descriptive name for the playbook or task.
- `hosts`: Specifies the host or group pattern to target.
- `become`: Optional directive to run tasks with elevated privileges (sudo).

**Example Playbook:**

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Web Servers
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Copy configuration file
      copy:
        src: /path/to/nginx.conf
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      notify: Restart Nginx
```

## 2.1.2 Best Practices

- **Indentation:** YAML relies on indentation, so ensure proper spacing.
- **Documentation:** Use comments (`#`) for explanations and documentation within playbooks.
- **Modularity:** Break down tasks into small, reusable roles for maintainability.
- **Idempotency:** Ensure tasks can be run multiple times without changing the result.
