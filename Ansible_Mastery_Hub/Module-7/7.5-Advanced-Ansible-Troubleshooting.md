# 7.5 Advanced Ansible Troubleshooting

## **Advanced Ansible Troubleshooting:**

Troubleshooting is a crucial skill for Ansible practitioners. Advanced troubleshooting techniques help identify and resolve complex issues that may arise during playbook execution.

## **Troubleshooting Strategies:**

1.  **Verbose Mode:**

    - Use verbose mode (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`) to get detailed information about playbook execution.
    - Increasing verbosity helps understand the sequence of tasks and identify issues.

    Example Verbose Execution:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -vv playbook.yml
    ```

2.  **Debugging Tasks:**

    - Insert debug tasks (`debug` module) in playbooks to print variable values and intermediate results.
    - Debugging tasks help diagnose problems within playbooks.

    Example Debug Task:

    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Debug Task
    hosts: all
    tasks:
        - name: Display Variable Value
        debug:
            var: my_variable
    ```

3.  **Reviewing Logs:**

    - Examine Ansible logs (`ansible.log`, `ansible-playbook.log`) for error messages and warnings.
    - Logs provide valuable information during troubleshooting.

    Example Checking Ansible Logs:

    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/ansible.log
    ```

4.  **Checkpoints and Validation:**

    - Insert checkpoints at various stages of playbooks to validate intermediate results.
    - Checkpoints help isolate issues to specific tasks and gather information at different stages.

    Example Adding Checkpoints:

    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Checkpoint Task
    hosts: all
    tasks:
        - name: Display Message
        debug:
            msg: "Checkpoint 1 - Tasks Completed"
    ```

5.  **Remote Debugging:**

    - Use Ansible's remote debugging capabilities to troubleshoot issues on managed hosts.
    - The `ansible-doc` command provides information on debugging techniques.

    Example Remote Debugging:

    ```bash
    ansible-doc -t callback | grep -A 10 remote
    ```

6.  **Red Hat Insights:**

    - Consider using Red Hat Insights with Ansible for proactive analysis and recommendations.
    - Insights provides insights into potential issues and best practices.

    Example Registering with Red Hat Insights:

    ```bash
    insights-client --register
    ```
