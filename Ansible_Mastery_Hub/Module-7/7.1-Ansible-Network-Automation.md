# 7.1 Ansible and Network Automation

- Network automation with Ansible involves using Ansible playbooks to configure and manage network devices.
- Ansible provides specialized modules to interact with network devices, making it a versatile tool for network automation.

### **Key Concepts:**

1.  **Network Modules:**

    - Ansible comes with a set of network modules for various vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Arista, etc.).
    - Modules provide abstractions for common networking tasks such as configuring interfaces, VLANs, and routing.

    Example Playbook (Configuring VLAN on Cisco devices):

    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Configure VLAN on Cisco Switches
    hosts: cisco_switches
    gather_facts: no
    tasks:
        - name: Configure VLAN
        ios_vlan:
            vlan_id: 100
            name: Production
            state: present
    ```

2.  **Inventory Configuration:**

    - Extend your inventory to include network devices.
    - Define specific parameters for each device, such as connection variables.

    Example Inventory (inventory.ini):

    ```ini
    [cisco_switches]
    switch1 ansible_host=192.168.1.1 ansible_network_os=ios ansible_user=admin ansible_password=secret
    switch2 ansible_host=192.168.1.2 ansible_network_os=ios ansible_user=admin ansible_password=secret
    ```

3.  **Roles for Network Automation:**

    - Organize your network automation tasks using Ansible roles.
    - Roles help modularize and reuse configurations across different devices.

    Example Role Structure:

    ```css
    roles/
    └── network_config
        ├── tasks
        │   └── main.yml
        ├── templates
        ├── files
        └── meta
            └── main.yml
    ```

4.  **Network Automation Use Cases:**

    - **Configuration Management:** Ensure consistent configurations across network devices.
    - **Automated Provisioning:** Automate the provisioning of new network resources.
    - **Compliance Checks:** Perform checks and remediation for compliance with network policies.
