# 7.2 Ansible and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Ansible:**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. Ansible supports IaC principles, enabling users to define and manage infrastructure using Ansible playbooks.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Declarative Playbooks:**

    - Ansible playbooks describe the desired state of the infrastructure.
    - Declarative playbooks focus on expressing the intended configuration rather than step-by-step instructions.

    Example Playbook (Declarative):

    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
    hosts: web_servers
    become: true
    tasks:
        - name: Install Nginx
        apt:
            name: nginx
            state: present
    ```

2.  **Idempotence:**

    - Ansible playbooks are designed to be idempotent.
    - Idempotence ensures that running a playbook multiple times produces the same result if the desired state is already achieved.

3.  **Version Control:**

    - Store Ansible playbooks and roles in version control systems (e.g., Git).
    - Version control enables collaboration, traceability, and rollback capabilities.

4.  **Infrastructure Versioning:**

    - Treat infrastructure configurations as code and version them.
    - Track changes to playbooks and roles, providing a history of infrastructure modifications.

    Example Playbook Versioning:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Update Nginx configuration"
    ```
